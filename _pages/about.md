Currently, I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium) within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (<a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/node/9330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISBA</a>). My research interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients. More information can be found in my <a href="/research/">research projects</a>.

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am <a href="/teaching/">teaching assistant</a> for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master's level. I also provide trainings and workshops in statistics and R (an open source statistical software program) as part of UCLouvain's technology platform for Support in Methodology and Statistical Computing (<a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/smcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMCS</a>). Given my experience, I also help academics and professionals in performing statistical data analyses for their academic or work related projects.

Prior to this PhD, I graduated in 2015 with a Master in Economics from KU Leuven and in 2016 with a Master in Econometrics from Maastricht University. You may see my <a href="/cv/">CV</a> to have a better overview of my academic and professional background.

In May 2015, I became an international tennis chair umpire (White Badge certification). Since then, I am fortunate enough to work regularly as a chair or line umpire on major tennis events across the world.<!-- This position allows me to develop leadership and teamwork skills, and a strong communication thanks to the guidance of internationally certified umpires.-->

In my spare time I like to play sports, learn to <a href="/software/">code</a> and write about statistics and its applications in R through my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>. I also enjoy reading nonfiction <a href="/files/booklist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">books</a> on statistics, (behavioral) economics, business/management/investing/personal finance or psychology and <a href="/files/visited-places.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traveling</a> around the globe.
