Currently, I am a PhD student in statistics at Universit√© catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium. My research focuses on bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients. More information can be found in my <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/p/research.html">research projects</a>. In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am&nbsp;<a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/p/teaching.html">teaching assistant</a> for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master's level and I provide training in statistics and R programming for UCLouvain's technology platform for Support in Methodology and Statistical Computing (SMCS).

Before this PhD, I worked as a data scientist at Business &amp; Decision and I did two internships; one at Deloitte Luxembourg as an audit intern and one at BNP Paribas as European public affairs intern.

Regarding my education, I graduated from KU Leuven with a Master in Economics in 2015 and from Maastricht University with a Master in Econometrics in 2016. You may see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/p/resume.html">my CV</a> to have a better overview of my academic and professional background.

In May 2015, I became an international tennis chair umpire (White Badge certification). Since then, I am fortunate enough to work regularly as a chair or line umpire on major tennis events across the world. This position allows me to develop leadership and teamwork skills, and a strong communication thanks to the guidance of internationally certified umpires.

In my spare time I like to play sports, read nonfiction <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/p/booklist.html">books</a> on statistics, economics, business / management / investing / personal finance or psychology and learn to <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/p/software.html">code</a>. I also enjoy traveling and discover new cultures and horizons.
