Currently, I am a PhD student in statistics at Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium, at the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (<a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/node/9330" target="_blank">ISBA</a>), under the supervision of Prof. C. Legrand and Prof. M. Denuit. My research interests focus on bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients. More information can be found in my <a href="http://www.antoinesoetewey.com/research/">research projects</a>. In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am <a href="http://www.antoinesoetewey.com/teaching/">teaching assistant</a> for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master's level and I provide trainings and workshops in statistics and R programming for UCLouvain's technology platform for Support in Methodology and Statistical Computing (<a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/smcs" target="_blank">SMCS</a>).

<!---
Before this PhD, I worked as a data scientist at Business &amp; Decision and I did two internships; one at Deloitte Luxembourg as an audit intern and one at BNP Paribas as European public affairs intern.

Before this PhD, I graduated from KU Leuven with a Master in Economics in 2015 and from Maastricht University with a Master in Econometrics in 2016. You may see my <a href="http://www.antoinesoetewey.com/cv/">CV</a> to have a better overview of my academic and professional background.

In May 2015, I became an international tennis chair umpire (White Badge certification). Since then, I am fortunate enough to work regularly as a chair or line umpire on major tennis events across the world.<!--- This position allows me to develop leadership and teamwork skills, and a strong communication thanks to the guidance of internationally certified umpires.-->

In my spare time I like to play sports, read nonfiction <a href="http://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/booklist.html" target="_blank">books</a> on statistics, (behavioral) economics, business / management / investing / personal finance or psychology and learn to <a href="http://www.antoinesoetewey.com/software/">code</a>. I also enjoy traveling and discover new cultures and horizons.
