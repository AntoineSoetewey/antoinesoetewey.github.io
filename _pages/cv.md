I am a PhD student in statistics at Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium, at the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (<a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/node/9330" target="_blank">ISBA</a>). My research interests focus on bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients.
